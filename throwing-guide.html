        <h2>Throwing Normally</h2>
        <p>To throw a football normally, follow these basic steps:</p>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Grip:</strong> Hold the ball with your fingers across the laces, with your thumb underneath and your index finger on top.</li>
            <li><strong>Stance:</strong> Stand with your feet shoulder-width apart, knees slightly bent, and body facing sideways to your target.</li>
            <li><strong>Arm Motion:</strong> Bring your throwing arm back, and then snap it forward, releasing the ball with your fingers to give it a good spiral.</li>
            <li><strong>Follow Through:</strong> After releasing the ball, your arm should follow through, finishing by pointing your thumb down and your fingers up.</li>
        </ol>

        <h2>Throwing Far</h2>
        <p>To throw the ball farther, you need to focus on power, precision, and technique. Here's how:</p>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Strong Grip:</strong> Your grip should be firm but not too tight. You want the ball to come off your fingers cleanly for maximum distance.</li>
            <li><strong>Use Your Legs:</strong> Your legs play a big role in generating power. Make sure to step forward with your opposite foot as you throw the ball.</li>
            <li><strong>Wind-Up:</strong> A bigger wind-up will help you generate more power. Rotate your torso and shift your weight onto your back foot.</li>
            <li><strong>Throw With Speed:</strong> The key to a long throw is speed. Generate as much speed as possible with your arm and torso rotation, and release the ball when you're at your peak.</li>
        </ol>
